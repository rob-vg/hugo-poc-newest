                    Interestingly, this is not Power40’s first venture into the world; the club first launched at the start of COVID-19 and promptly got placed on the back burner until later that year. According to Jeremy, even though the first iteration of the Power40 concept barely got off the ground, it provided <strong>a massive learning opportunity for what the club could and should look like.</strong>
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    When the possibility for a second launch arrived, armed with <strong>the right gym management system</strong> and a team of dedicated individuals, <strong>Power40 was ready for liftoff.</strong>

                  <p>
                    Despite launching amid a global pandemic, <strong>Power40 was able to grow</strong> <strong>because it recognized the importance of software solutions</strong>. And, when it came to choosing a gym management software, Jeremy and Wesley knew that the system needed to be flexible and as exciting as their concept – both visually and content-wise.

                  <p>
                    According to Wesley, COVID-19 taught us many things – one of which is that <strong>you must provide value outside of your physical location.</strong> The act of digitizing fit in perfectly with Power40’s philosophy to provide solutions that are widely accessible.

                      The pandemic has also caused a <strong>behavioral change in consumers themselves</strong>; priorities have shifted, and people value flexibility. They may no longer be completely willing to plan their schedules around going to the gym. <strong>A digital solution addresses this change in consumer demand.</strong>

                    Power40 is also beginning to <strong>shift its sights towards corporate wellness</strong> and take its parent company, the YMCA, to new levels of innovation. This small studio dreams big mainly thanks to <strong>the progressive attitudes of its staff.</strong>

                    The personal trainers, instructors, experts, and individuals who keep the studio running smoothly have flung the Power40 concept forward and <strong>adapted to technological change at every step of the way</strong>. The future looks bright for this Memphis-based fitness studio.
